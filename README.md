# MobOff

> A command line tool to add your music and videos directly to several devices.

## Why?

Almost all of use youtube for our music purposes, whether it is a new single released by Eminem or an old classic by Queen. 

Now we need to travel the next day and you realise that the `diff` between your offline mobile playlist and youtube playlist is too large.

Now you have to use an online mp3 converter to convert all the songs one by one, and then connect your device via USB to paste all the music. That too without the metadata.

There is a need for a tool which would directly download and convert the video, add available metadata and send it to your device, all at the same time.

### Enters *MobOff*.

## Features

* Download the best available audio, or video (by `--video` option) in common mobile player compatible extensions.
* Adds metadata automatically from the title.
* Add a preffered device to send music, or override it with `--newdevice` option.
* Delete the downloaded video/music file from the computer via `--delete` option.
